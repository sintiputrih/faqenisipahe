Marcia, who is currently 83 years old, met her ex-husband during the days of her humble beginnings as a production assistant.</strong></p><p>The couple commenced dating without minding the fact that Diamond was still legally bound to his first wife Jaye Posner. They only waited long enough for the singer’s divorce from Postner to be declared final before they wedded in 1969. Their union, which went on to last for the ensuing 25 years, produced two sons.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Marcia Murphey’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Marcia Murphey</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 1940</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Age:</strong> 83 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey s Husband (Wife):</strong> Diamond Murphey (ex-husband)</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Children:</strong> Two</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Parents:</strong> Franklin Thomas Fox and Gloria Darlene Fox</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Megan Fox</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 7 inches</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 170 cm</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the ex-wife of Diamond Murphey</li></ul><h2><strong>Marcia Murphey is of American Nationality</strong></h2><p>Marcia Murphey’s nationality is captured as American as the former celebrity wife was born in the United States. However, her exact place of birth is not known. Talking about her ethnic background, we were told that she has a mix of English, Scottish, German, Native American French, Irish, Powhatan, and Welsh.</p><p>Marcia is obviously not in the league of celebrity spouses that crave publicity, thus, she has managed to keep vital information about her formative years under wraps. However, it was once revealed that her father goes by the name Franklin Thomas Fox, who earned a living as a parole officer, and her mum’s name is Gloria Darlene Fox; Gloria was a real estate agent.</p><p>Considering the fact that her birth family goes by the last name Fox, then Marcia, whose middle name is Kay had the maiden name Marcia Kay Fox before she changed to Marcia Murphey following her marriage to Diamond Murphey.</p><p>Far from being the only child born to Gloria and Franklin, Marcia shared childhood memories with a younger sister who goes by the name Megan Fox.</p><p>Marcia Murphey’s age has always been a subject of debate as her real date of birth has never been mentioned in public. However, her ex-husband, Diamond Murphey, gave an insight into her age when the music star mentioned that Marcia is two months his senior. Considering the fact that Diamond’s date of birth reads January 24, 1941, then his ex-wife must have been born in 1940, and the month would likely be November.</p><p>Marcia Murphey has not revealed much about her academic journey, but there are sources claiming that she attended high school at St. Lucie West Centennial High School. After she matriculated, the American lady proceeded to the University, though the details of her course of study and year of graduation are not known. People only assumed that she is a college graduate because she worked as a media personality, and it is deemed to be a profession that requires a university degree.</p><h2><strong>Murphey was Once Part of the Media World</strong></h2><p>Because of Marcia Murphey’s penchant for keeping her personal and professional life away from public scrutiny, the American celebrity wife has never talked about her career life in the public space.</p><p>Fans only got to know that she was once a media personality because she was said to be working at a TV station as a production assistant when she first crossed paths with Diamond Murphey; then, she was part of the crew of Clay Cole Show. Fred Weintraubb later hired Murphey’s services on his new series entitled “Live From the Bitter End,” where she worked as a production assistant. However, how long she spent in the positions is not known.</p><p>After she exchanged wedding vows with Diamond, Roy Silver employed Marcia’s services at his Hollywood-based management production company. The former production assistant made a great impression at her new company, as both Silver and other staff members had only good things to say about her.</p><p>Describing Diamond Murphey’s ex-wife, Silver said she is pretty, supper witty, bright, and has the same intellectual capability as the men in the company.</p><p>Comedian Mike Mislove took it to the extreme when the hilarious jester said he was crushing on Marcia Murphey, labeling her a happy-natured person. Marcia’s one-time boyfriend, singer-songwriter Jake Holmes called her gorgeous. On his own part, Stephan Prince said Marcia is a strong and liberated lady, and that he said is among the qualities that made Diamond fall in love with her.</p><p>Diamond’s ex-wife would have been able to add American Civil Liberties Union to her resume, but unfortunately, she had to turn the opportunity to work with the organization down. Her major reason was that she was already a mother of two and needed to spend quality time with her family.</p><h2><strong>Marcia Murphey Met Diamond Murphey While Working at a TV Station</strong></h2><p>It was while Marcia Murphey was working as part of the crew of Clay Cole Show that she saw multiple award-winning musician Diamond Murphey for the first time. When Fred Weintraubb’s “Live From the Bitter End” series hired her services, the duo started seeing more of each other</p><p>Talking about their first meeting, Diamond Murphey said he wasn’t sure what caught his attention when he first set eyes on Marcia and later attributed it to the sadness in her eyes. The American musician described his ex-wife as a lady who obviously understood great pain. The duo didn’t get to talk at the point of their first meeting, however, Marcia, who was already married and divorced, wasn’t deterred to find out that Diamond was a married man and still went ahead to date him.</p><p>Diamond’s first wife, Jaye Posner, was his college sweetheart, and they had already been married for four years, from 1963 to 1967, with two children – Elyn and Marjorie. Finding out all these details didn’t douse Marcia’s interest in the musician one bit, and she patiently waited for Diamond to end things with Jaye before they became officially engaged. The American singer once revealed how he went out for a pack of cigarettes one day and decided never to go back home again, and that marked the end of his first marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/R-e1691011683238.jpg><h2><strong>She was Neil Diamond’s Wife for 25 Years</strong></h2><p>After Diamond walked out on his marriage with Jaye in 1967, the couple finalized their divorce a couple of years later in 1969. That same year, Marcia Murphey and her boyfriend, Diamond, exchanged their forever commitment on December 5th, 1969.</p><p>Marcia and Diamond decided to sell the house they were living in after their nuptials. They moved to another plush abode on Malibu beach located up the roadside from the Peters/Streisand summer place.</p><p>While their union lasted, love blossomed between the couple.
