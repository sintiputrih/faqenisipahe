Pfeiffer played Cybill Shepherd’s daughter, Rachel, on Cybill, and starred as Sheri Winston on The WB’s For Your Love. She can soon be seen in Based on True Events (its working title was L.A., I Hate You), starring Malcolm McDowell. Vamp, a fine cult classic starring Pfeiffer and Grace Jones, will be released on Blu-Ray later this year.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uyqqq0vonxm84xx7ugzt8@published data-word-count=6><a href=#>Josh Kurp</a> never dated George Costanza.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Checking In with…the Girlfriends of George Costanza, […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloamdgbHyktMScoqKml2K2r3nWoquhZaSdsm6zyKujn6qZmrulv4yonWaflaS%2FqLGMnKasrJGjx6J50p6YrKeeqHpyeZRnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fchecking-in-with-the-girlfriends-of-george-costanza-seasons-1-5-html.html&title=Checking%20In%20withthe%20Girlfriends%20of%20George%20Costanza%2c%20Seasons%201-5" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchecking-in-with-the-girlfriends-of-george-costanza-seasons-1-5-html.html&description=Checking%20In%20withthe%20Girlfriends%20of%20George%20Costanza%2c%20Seasons%201-5" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchecking-in-with-the-girlfriends-of-george-costanza-seasons-1-5-html.html&title=Checking%20In%20withthe%20Girlfriends%20of%20George%20Costanza%2c%20Seasons%201-5" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fchecking-in-with-the-girlfriends-of-george-costanza-seasons-1-5-html.html&title=Checking%20In%20withthe%20Girlfriends%20of%20George%20Costanza%2c%20Seasons%201-5" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fchecking-in-with-the-girlfriends-of-george-costanza-seasons-1-5-html.html&text=Checking%20In%20withthe%20Girlfriends%20of%20George%20Costanza%2c%20Seasons%201-5" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fchecking-in-with-the-girlfriends-of-george-costanza-seasons-1-5-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-03-19</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./david-minto-and-cedella-marley-the-parents-of-skip-marley.html><h3>&lt;&lt; David Minto and Cedella Marley: The Parents of Skip Marley</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./cedric-mcmillan.html><h3>Cedric McMillan >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
