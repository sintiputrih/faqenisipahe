You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. - Steve Jobs</span> <span class=caption-body>If you always put limits on everything you do, physical or anything else, it will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus; and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. - Bruce Lee</span> <span class=caption-body>"I'm bored" is a useless thing to say. I mean, you live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of. Even the inside of your own mind is endless; it goes on forever, inwardly, do you understand? The fact that you're alive is amazing, so you don't get to say 'I'm bored.' - Louis CK</span> <span class=caption-body>How lucky am I to have something that makes saying goodbye hard. - Winnie The Pooh</span> <span class=caption-body>This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness. - Dalai Lama</span> <span class=caption-body>Always forgive your enemies - nothing annoys them so much. - Oscar Wilde</span> <span class=caption-body>Recognize that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centers of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life. So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That's kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us. - Neil deGrasse Tyson</span> <span class=caption-body>The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter. - Mark Twain</span> <span class=caption-body>I don't count my sit-ups; I only start counting when it starts hurting because they’re the only ones that count. - Muhammad Ali</span> <span class=caption-body>When you tear out a man’s tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you’re only telling the world that you fear what he might say. - Tyrion Lannister</span> <span class=caption-body>Sometime, when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means that someone can love you again! And that'll make you smile. - Homer Simpson</span> <span class=caption-body>Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company. - Mark Twain</span> <span class=caption-body>You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own, and you know what you know. And you are the guy who'll decide where to go. - Dr. Seuss</span> <span class=caption-body>You can tell how smart people are by what they laugh at. - Tina Fey</span> <span class=caption-body>The good thing about science is that it’s true whether or not you believe in it. - Neil deGrasse Tyson</span> <span class=caption-body>The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. - Chinese Proverb</span> <span class=caption-body>Life is like riding a bicycle. In order to maintain balance, you must keep moving. - Albert Einstein</span> <span class=caption-body>The person that you will spend the most time with in your life is yourself, so you better try to make yourself as interesting as possible.</span> <span class=caption-body>Listen, smile, agree, and then do whatever the fuck you were going to do anyway. - Robert Downey Jr.</span> <span class=caption-body>Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant. - Robert Louis Stevenson</span> <span class=caption-body>If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. - Antoine de Saint</span> <span class=caption-body>You'll be fine. You're 25. Feeling unsure and lost is part of your path. Don't avoid it. See what those feelings are showing you and use it. Take a breath. You'll be okay. Even if you don't feel okay all the time. - Louis CK</span> <span class=caption-body>People aren’t against you; they are for themselves.</span> <span class=caption-body>The most dangerous risk of all – the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later.</span> <span class=caption-body>He who conquers others is strong, he who conquers himself is mighty. - Lao Tsu</span> <span class=caption-body>A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for. - John A. Shedd</span> <span class=caption-body>If there was an observer on Mars, they would probably be amazed that we have survived this long. - Noam Chomsky</span> <span class=caption-body>When you realize that no one really knows what they are doing and that everyone is doing the best they can according to their own level of consciousness, life gets a lot easier.</span> <span class=caption-body>Skeptical scrutiny is the means, in both science and religion, by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense. - Carl Sagan</span> <span class=caption-body>There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it. - Oscar Wilde</span> <span class=caption-body>Remember, people will judge you by your actions, not your intentions.</span> <span class=caption-body>Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. - Howard Thurman</span> <span class=caption-body>I think most kids have a sense that it's not supposed to be this way. You're not supposed to hate Monday, or be happy when you don't have to go to school. School should be something that you love. Life should be something that you love. - Charles Eisenstein</span> <span class=caption-body>I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops. - Stephen Jay Gould</span> <span class=caption-body>I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you. - Neil DeGrasse Tyson</span> <span class=caption-body>When you're 20 you care what everyone thinks, when you're 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you're 60 you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place.</span> <span class=caption-body>You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. - Winston Churchill</span> <span class=caption-body>In every block of marble I see a statue as plain as though it stood before me, shaped and perfect in attitude and action. I have only to hew away the rough walls that imprison the lovely apparition to reveal it to the other eyes as mine see it. - Michelangelo</span> <span class=caption-body>The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it. - Albert Einstein</span> <span class=caption-body>So avoid using the word 'very' because it’s lazy. A man is not very tired, he is exhausted. Don't use very sad, use morose. Language was invented for one reason, boys - to woo women - and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do. It also won't do in your essays.</span> <span class=caption-body>What you do today is important, because you are sacrificing a day of your life for it.</span> <span class=caption-body>Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured. - Mark Twain</span> <span class=caption-body>When you feel happy, really happy, it somehow seems that you've always been happy and that you'll always be happy.

Something, perhaps, to remember. - Mike Dooley</span> <span class=caption-body>Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. - Albert Einstein</span> <span class=caption-body>The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it. - George Carlin</span> <span class=caption-body>A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.</span> <span class=caption-body>An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching. - Mahatma Gandhi</span> <span class=caption-body>If you do what you’ve always done, you’ll get what you’ve always gotten. - Tony Robbins</span> <span class=caption-body>Everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something.</span> <span class=caption-body>Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones. - Marcus Aurelius</span> <span class=caption-body>You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day, unless you're too busy, then you should sit for an hour.</span> <span class=caption-body>If Tetris has taught me anything, it's that errors pile up and accomplishments disappear.</span> <span class=caption-body>Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson</span> <span class=caption-body>You can't have everything you want, but you can have the things that really matter to you. - Marissa Mayer</span> <span class=caption-body>Most folks are as happy as they make up their minds to be. - Abraham Lincoln</span> <span class=caption-body>Women who seek to be equal with men lack ambition. - Timothy Leary</span> <span class=caption-body>Write drunk.

In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity. - Hunter S. Thompson</span> <span class=caption-body>Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. - Steve Jobs</span> <span class=caption-body>Intelligence without ambition is a bird without wings. - Salvadore Dali</span> <span class=caption-body>I refuse to accept other people’s ideas of happiness for me. As if there’s a ‘one size fits all’ standard for happiness. - Kanye West</span> <span class=caption-body>When you are courting a nice girl an hour seems like a second.

Hack away at the unessential. - Bruce Lee</span> <span class=caption-body>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said "faster horses". - Henry Ford</span> <span class=caption-body>But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright Brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown. - Carl Sagan</span> <span class=caption-body>Anger and intolerance are the enemies of correct understanding. - Mahatma Gandhi</span> <span class=caption-body>Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had. - F. Scott Fitzgerald</span> <span class=caption-body>That's been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex.

Lewis</span> <span class=caption-body>In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population. - Noam Chomsky</span> <span class=caption-body>The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. - Albert Camus</span> <span class=caption-body>That's the best revenge of all: happiness. Nothing drives people crazier than seeing someone have a good fucking life. - Chuck Palahniuk</span> <span class=caption-body>They say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time. - Banksy</span> <span class=caption-body>Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everybody I've ever known. - Chuck Palahniuk</span> <span class=caption-body>There are essentially only two drugs that Western civilization tolerates: Caffeine from Monday to Friday to energize you enough to make you a productive member of society, and alcohol from Friday to Monday to keep you too stupid to figure out the prison that you are living in. - Bill Hicks</span> <span class=caption-body>You will not be punished for your anger, you will be punished by your anger. - Buddha</span> <span class=caption-body>The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads.

It's like, 'No dude, YOU are fucking awesome!' - Bill Burr</span> <span class=caption-body>Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't. - Bill Nye</span> <span class=caption-body>The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you.

The ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things. They push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do. - Steve Jobs</span> 100 of 101 101 of 101<p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Interesting Quotes" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/interesting-quotes.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> 99 Interesting Quotes That Will Open Your Mind View Gallery<p class=dropcaps>While we can't take all of our wisdom from just a few choice words, or even choice sentences, there's just something about a perfectly phrased quote that can open our minds and our hearts, causing us to think and feel things we may not have even thought possible before.</p><p>Interesting quotes like these — especially when they come from luminaries like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Albert Einstein</a>, Steve Jobs, or Neil DeGrasse Tyson — can actually shape how we see the world. These words can define who we are and who we will become.</p><p>Whether these quotes come from the world of science, politics, the arts, and beyond, they are the words that we live by. But, sometimes, the words we live by don't come from such lofty places at all, but instead from the world of pop culture. After all, just because the following was said by Homer Simpson doesn't make it any less poignant: "Sometime, when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. And that means that someone can love you again! And that'll make you smile."</p><p>Then there are the unquestionably brilliant thinkers that you fully expect to blow your mind, and they do. These are people like Noam Chomsky and Bill Nye, who will dazzle you even with straightforward wisdom like: "Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't."</p><p>And that's certainly true of the great minds of this list. So, from the bitingly insightful quotes of Mark Twain to the poignant aphorisms of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Lee</a>, enjoy a fresh outlook on life with these interesting quotes that will change how you see the world, in the gallery above.</p><p>And if you enjoyed these interesting quotes, be sure to see All That Is Interesting's most <a href=#>interesting articles</a> as well as other posts on <a href=#>interesting facts</a> and some of history's <a href=#>best insults</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyqutOeqZ6rpJ67qHnQrqatnaM%3D</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2finteresting-quotes.html&title=99%20Interesting%20Quotes%20That%27ll%20Kick%20Open%20The%20Door%20To%20Your%20Mind" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finteresting-quotes.html&description=99%20Interesting%20Quotes%20That%27ll%20Kick%20Open%20The%20Door%20To%20Your%20Mind" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finteresting-quotes.html&title=99%20Interesting%20Quotes%20That%27ll%20Kick%20Open%20The%20Door%20To%20Your%20Mind" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2finteresting-quotes.html&title=99%20Interesting%20Quotes%20That%27ll%20Kick%20Open%20The%20Door%20To%20Your%20Mind" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2finteresting-quotes.html&text=99%20Interesting%20Quotes%20That%27ll%20Kick%20Open%20The%20Door%20To%20Your%20Mind" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2finteresting-quotes.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Reinaldo Massengill</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-03-10</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./dan-fogelbergs-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Dan Fogelbergs Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./asrock-industrial-4x4-box7840u-minipc-review-phoenix-in-an-ucff-avatar.html><h3>System Performance: Multi-Tasking - ASRock Industrial 4X4 BOX-7840U mini-PC Review: AMD Phoenix in a >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
