She is a nervous wreck, clutching my hand and whispering this is the first party she’s given for tout Hollywood. There are 26 people at a rather beautiful table.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The flower arrangements are stunning.

All they want to do is eat their caviar and get the hell out of there in time to watch the ten o’clock news.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the entrée [billionaire’s wife] Barbara Davis announces gleefully, ‘Why don’t we all go around the table and everyone say how we feel about Roger.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An audible sigh of horror escapes from everybody. ‘I don’t want to perform,’ mutters Greg Peck, but around the table we go.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Everybody brings out the platitudes. When it comes to me I say — which I think is quite witty but doesn’t get even a titter except from Roger — ‘Darling Roger, I’ve known you through thick and through thin, and through Tony Curtis.’ (They disliked each other.)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During everybody’s speeches, Sinatra keeps saying in a loud voice like a five-year-old: ‘What’s going on — why is everybody talking — is it time to leave yet?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Veronique Peck tries to soothe the savage beast’s brow. Marvin Davis speaks, then Niven Jr, who is very witty, and we finally finish.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I’m quite enjoying myself as Niven and I keep making silly faces at each other across the table.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After the birthday cake and the obligatory singing, there is a stampede to the exit, but I can’t get out as Kristina grabs my arm in terror. ‘Why is everybody leaving?’ she whispers. ‘It’s only just turned 11 o’clock.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘That’s Hollywood,’ I say, and whisper to Niven, ‘We must stay for a bit longer.’ I still don’t understand this desperation to get away from any social event, but everyone does it.</p><img decoding=async id=i-a55bcbf1f0b3154a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/04/21/48714597-10058759-image-a-141_1633380340781.jpg height=904 width=634 alt="Joan Collins meets Princess Diana in London, circa 1987" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><img decoding=async id=i-a55bcbf1f0b3154a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/04/21/48714597-10058759-image-a-141_1633380340781.jpg height=904 width=634 alt="Joan Collins meets Princess Diana in London, circa 1987" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Joan Collins meets Princess Diana in London, circa 1987</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">October 20</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>[Publicist] Jeffrey Lane picks me up and we go to Alana’s [Rod Stewart’s ex-wife] for a small, very fun dinner.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Sit around the dinner table until half-past ten telling stories and really enjoying ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s practically unheard of in Hollywood to do this, as everyone wants to escape and nobody really has that much to say to each other.</p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead">October 21</h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>[Producer] Gary Pudney picks me up and we go to Mortons for dinner — the fashionable Monday nightspot.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It’s full of bigwigs and studio heads, but I don’t understand how people recognise each other since everybody looks so alike.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gary says: ‘Get all the money you can and sock it away so you can go and live where the real people are — the other side of the Atlantic.’ He’s right — there’s a barrenness to life out here.
