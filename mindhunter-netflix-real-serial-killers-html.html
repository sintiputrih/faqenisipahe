The show’s fictional profiler, FBI agent Holden Ford, makes reference to infamous criminals like Charles Manson and David Berkowitz, but what about the other <a href=#>serial killers</a> who appear on the show? <a href=#>Is Wayne Williams a real person</a>? Were the good guys inspired by actual FBI agents? Below, we separate fact from fiction to explain what’s real and what isn’t in Mindhunter.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjziid2d4000r3a66iu9t5tqr@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Good Guys</span></h2><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjziidsex00113a66ns6hbqbp@published>Holden Ford</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ec9/25a/d59bab23b6dca71d8e9f7808a6f6af156a-19-tench-ressler.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8yuid5400033k5yko8hiff4@published data-word-count=126>The complex leading man of Mindhunter, played perfectly by Jonathan Groff, is based on <a href=#>John E. Douglas</a>, the author of the book Mindhunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit. Douglas is no stranger to Hollywood: He reportedly served as the main inspiration for Jack Crawford in the novels Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs, as well as Bryan Fuller’s take on Will Graham in the TV show Hannibal. In Mindhunter, Ford walks a similar path as an agent in the FBI’s Behavioral Sciences Unit, traveling the country to interview some of the most notorious criminals in American history. In reality, Douglas redefined murder investigations thanks to information gleaned from interviews with David Berkowitz, John Wayne Gacy, Charles Manson, Richard Speck, and <a href=#>Edmund Kemper</a>.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjziidzir00163a66zm9denvu@published>Bill Tench</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c28/6ab/6bd5257c49778d92bc3462c12d2a162d3f-19-burgess-torv.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8yuiypu00073k5y2s5qoynx@published data-word-count=113>The parallels between Holt McCallany’s gruff FBI agent and his real-life counterpart are less direct than those between Ford and Douglas, but they’re still there. Tench was inspired heavily by Robert K. Ressler, a Chicago-born FBI agent who joined the Bureau in 1970. Ressler was also a part of the Behavioral Sciences Unit in the ’70s and is credited with coining the term “serial killer.” Ressler also interviewed serial killers in the ’80s and developed the nation’s first computer database of unsolved crimes, which helped capture those who crossed state lines as they killed. He worked on major serial-killer cases, including the searches for Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy. Ressler died in 2013.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjziieada001f3a666w1x5m4y@published>Dr. Wendy Carr</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/82e/cdf/8ddb78ea96dbbd53523b2e318f53f6d9a1-michael-cervais.rsquare.w570.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj8yuiypw00083k5ylnwagpxq@published data-word-count=87>Often the voice of reason and logic on Mindhunter, Anna Torv’s psychologist has a real-life counterpart in Dr. Ann Wolbert Burgess.

Kemper killed his grandparents as a teenager but was later released from a mental hospital at age 21.

He stands out for how early he started his rampage, reportedly committing his first rape at the age of 14. Like Kemper, Rissell was sent to an mental institution, and he’s known for convincing his counselors that he was getting better even as he surreptitiously committed crimes while on short leave.

He really was the younger son to a mother who wanted him to be a daughter, and his fetish for women’s shoes started at a very young age. Brudos, played by Happy Anderson, was sent to a mental hospital after his first crime, abducting a woman when he was only 17. He appeared to settle down in the years following his release, getting married and having two children, but then he went on a murder spree beginning in 1968.

He had previously committed violent acts, but it was the horror of the singular event that made headlines around the world, especially because one woman escaped to describe the nightmare. In Mindhunter, Speck is an aggressive monster, and it’s when Ford sinks to his level that he puts his career in jeopardy — even sparking an internal FBI investigation at <a href=#>the start of season two</a>.

Douglas writes about the case in his book, making it clear that it was his first chance to stage an interrogation. The fake folder of papers that makes it look like the cops had a lot on Devier, the gross implication that the victim was asking for it to weaken the suspect’s defenses, and the bloody rock placed in front of him: All of these tactics were actually used in Douglas’s interrogation of Devier, and they ultimately led to his confession.

Berkowitz, played in the show by Oliver Cooper, did actually retract his more exaggerated claims at a press conference in 1979, and Ford’s real-life counterpart, John E. Douglas, claimed to have seen through his Son of Sam persona immediately.

There are many elements of the Williams interview that contrast with others seen on the show, but the biggest may be that Williams never confessed to the Atlanta child murders — unlike so many of the killers who practically boast when they speak to Ford and Tench. The real Williams was convicted of killing two adult men in 1981, and police have since tied him to the murders of several children in Atlanta during that same time period, though he was never charged in those cases and still maintains his innocence. For many Atlanta residents, <a href=#>including relatives of some murdered children</a>, the case remains unsolved, although it’s worth noting that the killings did stop after Williams’s arrest. There is a great deal of <a href=#>footage out there of Williams</a>, and Livingston’s impersonation of the man is startlingly accurate.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjzyeyfqr001cg2y6t40o0yh9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The True Story Behind Mindhunter’s Atlanta Child Murders</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjzofrc7q000m4nyeo923uva2@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Let’s Talk About the Mindhunter Season-Two Finale</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjzk9ebpc0000y0y6lbnnqmi4@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How One Actor Wound Up Playing Charles Manson in Mindhunter and Once Upon a Time</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Real Serial Killers Who Inspired Netflix’s Mindhunter</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlocGdhZXyutc2dn66mpJq%2FbrrErZ2loahiv6aty2aqnqqZlrlut8ilo56qo2O1tbnL</p></content><div></div><section class=sk3-margin-v-full><section class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h"><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><sk3-social><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=%2fmindhunter-netflix-real-serial-killers-html.html&title=The%20Real%20Serial%20Killers%20and%20FBI%20Agents%20Who%20Inspired%20Netflixs%20Mindhunter" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"LinkedIn","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#linkedin"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmindhunter-netflix-real-serial-killers-html.html&description=The%20Real%20Serial%20Killers%20and%20FBI%20Agents%20Who%20Inspired%20Netflixs%20Mindhunter" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Pinterest","width=800,height=720,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#pinterest"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmindhunter-netflix-real-serial-killers-html.html&title=The%20Real%20Serial%20Killers%20and%20FBI%20Agents%20Who%20Inspired%20Netflixs%20Mindhunter" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Reddit","width=832,height=624,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#reddit"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//t.me/share/url?url=%2fmindhunter-netflix-real-serial-killers-html.html&title=The%20Real%20Serial%20Killers%20and%20FBI%20Agents%20Who%20Inspired%20Netflixs%20Mindhunter" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Telegram","width=800,height=600,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#telegram"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet/?url=%2fmindhunter-netflix-real-serial-killers-html.html&text=The%20Real%20Serial%20Killers%20and%20FBI%20Agents%20Who%20Inspired%20Netflixs%20Mindhunter" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"Twitter","width=800,height=450,resizable=yes,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#twitter"/></svg></a><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//vk.com/share.php?url=%2fmindhunter-netflix-real-serial-killers-html.html" onclick='return window.open(this.href,"VK","width=640,height=480,toolbar=0,status=0"),!1'><svg class="sk3-social-fab"><use xlink:href="#vk"/></svg></a></sk3-social></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><div class=sk3-margin-h><h3>Jenniffer Sheldon</h3></div><div class="sk3-margin-h sk3-margin-down">Update: 2024-01-15</div></div></div><div class="sk3-card sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h box"><div class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-v sk3-flex-center-h"><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./206004-comedian-bill-burr-what-we-know-his-fami-html.html><h3>&lt;&lt; Comedian Bill Burr What We Know about His Family and Recent Career Moves</h3></a><a class="sk3-margin-h txt-center-h" href=./the-asus-rog-strix-z270g-gaming-motherboard-review.html><h3>The Asus ROG Strix Z270G Gaming Motherboard Review >></h3></a></div></div></section></section><div></div></div></div><footer class="sk3-flex sk3-flex-center-h sk3-margin-v-full sk3-pad-v-full"><div class="sk3-pad-h txt-center-h">©
